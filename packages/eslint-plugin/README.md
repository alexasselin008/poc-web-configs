## Plugin-Provided Rules 

This plugin provides the following custom rules, which are included as appropriate in all core linting configs:

- [prefer-cx](docs/rules/prefer-cx.md): Prefer cx over classnames as the name of classnames imports.
- [restrict-full-import](docs/rules/restrict-full-import.md): Prevent importing the entirety of a package.
- [strict-css-modules-names](docs/rules/strict-css-modules-names.md): CSS modules should have the same file name (minus the file extension) as the scoped component and be located in the same folder.
